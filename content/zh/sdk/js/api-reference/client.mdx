# Client

`Client` is the low-level API client that provides direct access to the Scalebox REST API. In most cases, you should use `Sandbox` or `AsyncSandbox` instead of using Client directly.

## Import

```python
from scalebox.api.client import Client

```

## Create Client

```python
from scalebox import ConnectionConfig

config = ConnectionConfig(api_key="your-api-key")
client = Client(config)

```

## Main Methods

Client provides low-level methods for interacting with the Scalebox API, including:

- Create and manage sandboxes
- Execute code
- File system operations
- Process management

> **📝 注意**

> For most use cases, we recommend using `Sandbox` or `AsyncSandbox`, which provide a more user-friendly high-level API.

## Next Steps

- [Sandbox](/sdk/core/sandbox) - Use high-level Sandbox API
- [AsyncSandbox](/sdk/core/async-sandbox) - Use asynchronous Sandbox API
