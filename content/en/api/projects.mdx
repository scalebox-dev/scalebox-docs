## Project Concepts

Projects in ScaleBox provide a way to organize your sandboxes into logical groups for better management
and organization of your development environments.

**Project Features
Organization**

Group related sandboxes together by project, team, or purpose

## API Endpoints

**
**

Default:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/v1/projects` | Create a new project to organize sandboxes |

### create-project

**POST** `/v1/projects`

Create a new project to organize sandboxes

## Project Management

Best practices for effective project management in ScaleBox:

**Default Project**

Set one project as default to automatically organize new sandboxes

**Project Naming**

Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose or team (e.g., "frontend-team", "api-development")

**Sandbox Organization**

Group related sandboxes by project phase, environment type, or development team

## Sandbox Organization

Projects provide flexible ways to organize sandboxes:

**Automatic Assignment**

New sandboxes are automatically assigned to your default project

**Manual Management**

Use add/evict endpoints to move sandboxes between projects as needed

**Project Deletion**

Projects must be empty of sandboxes before they can be deleted

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and how to handle them:

**Project Name Validation**

Names must be 2-100 characters and follow standard naming conventions

**Access Control**

Users can only access projects within their account

**Project Dependencies**

Projects with sandboxes cannot be deleted - move or delete sandboxes first
