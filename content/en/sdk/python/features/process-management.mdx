# Process Management

Scalebox SDK provides process management capabilities, allowing you to start, monitor, and terminate processes in the sandbox.

## Start Process

```python
from scalebox.code_interpreter import Sandbox

sandbox = Sandbox.create()

# Start process

process = sandbox.commands.run("python long_running_script.py")

# Get process information

print(f"PID: {process.pid}")
print(f"Command: {process.cmd}")

```

## Wait for Process Completion

```python

# Start process

process = sandbox.commands.run("sleep 5")

# Wait for completion

process.wait()

print(f"Process completed, exit code: {process.exit_code}")

```

## Terminate Process

```python

# Start long-running process

process = sandbox.commands.run("sleep 1000")

# Terminate process

sandbox.commands.kill(process.pid)

```
