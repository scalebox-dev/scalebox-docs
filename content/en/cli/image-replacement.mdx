## Troubleshooting

Solution: Ensure you're using an admin API key, not a regular user key.

Check: scalebox-cli auth whoami to verify your authentication.

Solution: Use absolute paths or ensure the file exists: ls -la your-image.tar

Check: File must be a valid Docker tar archive created with docker save.

Solution: Start Docker: sudo systemctl start docker (Linux) or start Docker Desktop.

Check: docker version should show both client and server versions.

Solution: Check network connectivity to Harbor registry.

Check: Verify Harbor credentials are valid with the backend.

🚀 Pro Tip: Automation-Ready

Image replacement works great in CI/CD pipelines! Export your built images and use the CLI to update templates automatically.
